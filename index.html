        <h3>Assaulting someone physically:</h3>
          <p>Hitting someone physically is a surefire way to get someone angry, regardless if you did it for no reason or as retaliation for someone doing or saying something terrible to you.
             There's something about getting hurt physically, even more so if someone inflicts it. 
             Physical fights usually happen once arguments reach their peak and if people cannot control their anger anymore. As much as possible, one should not easily hit someone for any reason,
              as you will most likely also get hit by who you attacked and get into worst-case scenarios.</p>

          <h3>Verbal assault:</h3>
            <p>Verbal assault is a speech associated with threatening behavior meant to inflict pain on someone and trigger anger. 
              It can range from shouting at someone, swearing, making threats, name-calling, blackmailing, using words that degrade others' reputations, etc. 
              It is not a healthy way of communication, and depending on the person, people may retaliate when you do this kind of speech to them. 
              Once or twice may not make someone feel anger, but assault someone verbally multiple times, and you are probably going to reap what you sow. 
              Attacking someone verbally may not feel as impactful as a physical assault, but sometimes, they can sting more than a physical hit, turning anybody into an angry person.</p>

          <h3>Ignoring someone:</h3>
            <p>Validation, acceptance, and recognition are some things that many people want to receive from others. 
              Not being accepted for who we are or not getting recognized for our efforts can be a deal-breaker for some of us and make us harbor ill feelings toward others,
               especially for those that are supposed to give these things to us, such as a supervisor at work who is tasked with giving us feedback or people 
               who are the audiences of something we like to show. Ignorance can also be where a person feels like an invisible existence because others don't notice them, or none of their
               efforts get merit from others. Being ignored for a long time can build up anger and aggression in one's mind and cause them to do actions that may hurt others if left unchecked.</p>

          <h3>Trolling online:</h3>
          <p>Trolling is when someone posts or comments online to ‘bait’ people, which means deliberately provoking an argument or emotional reaction. 
            In some cases they say things they don’t even believe, just to cause drama. In other cases, they may not agree with the views of another person or group online,
             so they try to discredit, humiliate or punish them. This may include online hate – personal attacks that target someone because of their race, culture, religion, 
             gender, sexual orientation or disability. The troll may also encourage mob mentality, urging others to join in the attack so it becomes a pile on.
            Trolls often post under a fake name or anonymously, so they can say things without being held responsible. This can make them feel more powerful and less cautious
             than they would be if they were talking to someone ‘IRL’ or in person. This makes it difficult to identify who actually left the post or comment.
            Trolls also often try to downplay the impact of their behaviour, claiming anyone who’s upset by their posts or comments is overreacting. They may say it was just a joke, 
            or the person who they targeted needs to toughen up. This can make the person who was trolled feel even worse.</p>

          <p>Carry a fork with you. If someone tries to rob you, pull it out of your pocket and say, ‘thank you Lord for this meal I’m about to have’ and charge at them with the fork.</p>
